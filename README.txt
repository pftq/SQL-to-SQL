This is a quick application for copying all rows from one SQL table to another of the same columns.  It is particularly useful for copying between SQL tables on different servers, as then it is not as simple as just running a single SQL query.  Note that this assumes there are no existing rows of the same primary key already in the destination table.
  
As with my other scripts, this was created in C# for a few tasks I needed to get done, but perhaps others out there might also find it useful.
